# Cleo Graduate Frontend Interview

## Overview

Today we'll be pairing on a React application that allows users to convert currencies from one unit to another, based on a selection. The application itself has already been started by another team and our goal would be to:

1. Add some missing features from the project board
2. Add tests for features we add
3. Fix some bugs from the project board
4. Fix any bugs we come across

The teams project manager has set up a project board for us to track various features/bugs, which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/meetcleo/fe-graduate-interview/projects/1).

Each card on the project board has information about it's requirements, so take a moment to familiarise yourself with them and feel free to ask questions. Our goal is to work through the cards on that project board together in whichever order you feel works best.

It's important to note that whilst there may be bugs on that project board, not all may have been reported yet. As such, we can look to fix anything we find during our session.

## Getting started

This is a React application and as such, you'll need to have installed on your machine a few dependencies:

1. Node.js
2. Git (plus a Github account)
3. Yarn or NPM

With the above installed, you'll need to fork this Github repo locally to your machine.

There are various commands already available for you to run:

### Start the dev server

Runs the local development server on port 3000.

```console
$ yarn start
```

### Run the API

Runs the local API with database

```console
$ yarn api
```

### Testing

Runs tests via Jest and React Testing Library

```console
$ yarn test
```

## Notes

- We are about good vibes and working as a team to solve things
- Remember to think out loud so you and your interviewer are aligned
- Feel free to Google something if you're unsure. Also remember you can ask your interviewer
- Ask questions and clarify things if you need to
- Whilst finishing the task is great, we're more keen to see how you work and solve problems
